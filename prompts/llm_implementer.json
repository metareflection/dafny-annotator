Your output should be a valid Dafny program starting with a line \"// BEGIN DAFNY\", ending with a line \"// END DAFNY\". The program should be simple -- it is OK to not fully implement the idea I gave, but try to propose something related to it. To maximize the chance that the output is correct, please do not be overly ambitious (propose 1-3 methods and/or data structures, as seems fit), yet still be a bit creative. Do not include a Main() method -- think of this as an evolving project. Also, don't include testing functions - we just want functions that satisfy their formal specifications. We're most interested in getting examples of loop invariants."
