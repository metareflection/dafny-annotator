Generate $N high-level ideas for new verified functional programs, including a brief description of what the program could accomplish and what might be verified about it. The program will consists of datatypes, functions and lemmas relating the functions -- it should be side effect free, without imperative methods. Aim for short, 1-3 sentence descriptions, and try to maximize diversity. Output $N lines, each one containing one idea, in the format \"<index>. <idea>\", where <index> starts at 1, and <idea> is your description."}
